\chapter{Abstract}

Denotational semantics aims to understand computer programs by assigning
mathematical meaning to the syntax of a programming language.
%
In this course we will study a simple functional programming language called
PCF. Notably, this language has general recursion through a fixed point
operator.
%
This means a simple denotational semantics based on sets is not
suitable. Instead, we interpret the types of PCF as certain partially ordered
sets leading to domain theory and Scott's model of PCF in particular.
%
The central theorems of soundness and computational adequacy, formulated and
proved by Plotkin, then tell us that a PCF program computes to a value if and
only if their interpretations in the model are equal.
