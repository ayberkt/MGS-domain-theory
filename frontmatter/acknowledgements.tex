\chapter{Acknowledgements}

It is my pleasure to thank Mart\'in Escard\'o who introduced me to the beautiful
subjects of denotational semantics and domain theory. I am also grateful for his
comments on earlier drafts of these notes.

Additionally, I wish to express my thanks to Ayberk Tosun for proof-reading and
suggesting several improvements.
