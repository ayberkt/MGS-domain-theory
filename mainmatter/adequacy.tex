\chapter{Computational adequacy}\label{chap:comp-adequacy}

Soundness is a nice and fundamental result, but a converse would be more
interesting: Can we use the model to compute in PCF? More precisely, if two
terms \(M\) and \(N\) are equal in the model, does \(M\) reduce to \(N\) (or
vice versa) in the operational semantics?

This is actually not the case, because the model is less intrinsic than PCF,
e.g.\ the programs \(\lambdadot{\var x : \pcfnat}{\var x}\) and
\(\lambdadot{\var x : \pcfnat}{\pcfpred\pa*{\pcfsuc\,\var x}}\) are different
values in PCF, but their interpretations as \(\omega\)-continuous functions are
equal.

However, it \emph{is} the case that if \(M\) is a program of type \(\pcfnat\)
and \(\densem{M} = n\), then \(M \bigstep \numeral{n}\).
%
This is known as the \emph{computational adequacy} of the Scott model of PCF and
allows us to compute in PCF using the domain-theoretic denotational semantics.

\begin{theorem}[Computational adequacy]\label{adequacy}
  For every program \(M\) of type \(\pcfnat\) and natural number \(n \in \Nat\),
  if \(\densem{M} = n\), then \(M \bigstep \numeral n\).
\end{theorem}

Unlike soundness, computational adequacy cannot be proved by a straightforward
induction on types, or structure of the derivation of the program \(M\), since
the statement refers to closed terms of type \(\pcfnat\) only.

Therefore, instead of proving computational adequacy directly, we will derive it
as a corollary of a more general result that does allow for a proof by
induction on types.

More specifically, we will introduce a \emph{logical
  relation}~\cite{Plotkin1973}. It is an example of a fundamental and often used
technique in the theory of programming languages, going back to \emph{Tait's
  method of computability}~\cite{Tait1967} and also known as the method of
\emph{reducibility candidates}~\cite{Girard1989}.
